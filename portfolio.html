    <h2> OH NO!!! This rover got stuck on this random planet and we have to find out where on the planet it is! The rover has sensors to communicate with us the numbers of what it is sensing, but not what it is sensing. These are our graphs. One is a graph made from the information from the rover, and the other graph is one of our predicted graphs that we thought one of the locations would look like. <h2>
